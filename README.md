# Sean Ghaeli Portfolio - Backend

Welcome to the source code repository for the backend of my portfolio website, [seanghaeli.com](https://www.seanghaeli.com).

This repository is not just a means to power my portfolio website, it also serves as a showcase of my coding abilities. As you explore the codebase, you'll notice a couple of key themes:

1. **Modularity**: I strongly believe in the principle of "Separation of Concerns". Each module, class, and function has been designed with a specific task in mind, ensuring that each piece of the system can evolve independently as needed.

2. **Code Reuse**: Reducing code duplication is critical in maintaining a clean and manageable codebase. Wherever applicable, I have strived to keep the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in mind to avoid redundancy and ensure efficient code.

I invite you to explore this codebase. Feedback, questions, and discussions are always welcome. 

Thank you for your interest in my work!

- Sean
